#  OOP Project — Employee Management System

This project is a practical implementation of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts using C++.  
It was built as part of the **ITI OOP Lab (1)** assignment and focuses on modeling real-world entities such as people, employees, cars, and offices.

# Project Overview
The project simulates a simple office environment, representing how employees, cars, and offices are related.  
It demonstrates key OOP principles including:
- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance**
- **Composition / Aggregation**
- **Constructors & Destructors**
- **Class Relationships**

# Classes Implemented
## `Person`
Represents basic personal information such as name, age, and address.

# `Employee` *(Derived from Person)*
Extends the `Person` class by adding attributes like:
- Employee ID  
- Job title  
- Salary  
- Associated office or car  

It includes member functions for displaying employee details and calculating payments or bonuses.

# `Car`
Represents a car assigned to an employee, containing attributes like:
- Model  
- Plate number  
- Color  

# `Office`
Represents the workplace or department.  
It includes details such as:
- Office ID  
- Location  
- List of employees working there  

 Features
- Demonstrates **class relationships** and **object composition**.  
- Shows **inheritance** and **method overriding**.  
- Handles object creation and destruction using constructors and destructors.  
- Structured, readable, and beginner-friendly code following OOP design principles.

 Learning Goals
This project helps understand how to:
- Design and relate multiple classes in a single system.  
- Apply OOP fundamentals to model real-world entities.  
- Build maintainable and reusable code in C++.
